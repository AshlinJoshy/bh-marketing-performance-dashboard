/**
 * Find a LinkedIn actor that actually returns a company's posts.
 *
 * Why this exists: the LinkedIn scrape has been guessed at three times and got
 * it wrong three times, because an actor's real input schema can't be read from
 * outside — and the environment this repo is developed in has apify.com blocked
 * by network policy, so no actor can be tried there. The deployment CAN reach
 * Apify, so the search runs here instead: hit /api/perf/probe and it tries each
 * candidate against a real company page and reports what came back.
 *
 * A FAILED attempt is useful too. Apify rejects bad input with an error naming
 * the fields it expected, so a validation failure reveals the schema — which is
 * why every attempt's error text is reported rather than swallowed.
 *
 * Actor ids below are only ones seen as real Apify store URLs; none are invented.
